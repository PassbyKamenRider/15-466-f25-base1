# Bullet Diver

Author: Yifan Jiang (yifanj3)

## Design:

The game is an endless arcade-style bullet hell where players must dodge and attack moving enemies to achieve higher scores. I originally planned to make more intricate bullet trails, but due to PPU sprite limitations, I used sine-wave enemy movement to both constrain player positioning and increase gameplay difficulty.

## How Your Asset Pipeline Works:

<!-- (TODO: describe the steps in your asset pipeline, from source files to tiles/backgrounds/whatever you upload to the PPU466.)

(TODO: make sure the source files you drew are included. You can [link](your/file.png) to them to be a bit fancier.) -->

1) PNGs in the `assets/` folder are loaded as vectors of RGBA values using the helper function `load_png`.
2) For each PNG, I use `build_palette` to extract 4 unique colors from it and store them to PPU's `palette_table`.
3) Then, each PNG will be sliced to 8x8 PPU tiles using the helper function `build_tiles`. My player and enemy sprites are 16x16 so they will be stored as 4 8x8 tiles. Their tile data will be computed by the cloest color in the palette we create above.
4) The tile data and palette index are assigned to the PPUâ€™s tile and sprite tables. Player, enemy, and projectile sprites are mapped to specific indices, the helper function `load_tiles` will return a vector of these indices for later rendering use.
5) In the `draw` function, we dynamically change the position of these tiles to achieve movement and collision detection.

## How To Play:

### Controls:
Use `WASD` to move the character. The character automatically fires bullets forward.

### Enemies:
- Overseer:
    - Moves in a sine-wave pattern
    - Shoots projectiles downward

- Voteless:
    - Moves straight downward
    - Deals damage on contact

### Objective:
Survive as long as possible while dodging enemy attacks and eliminating foes.
